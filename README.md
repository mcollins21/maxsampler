## About this Project
The maxSampler is an immersive audio project built using Max/MSP, designed to provide users with a high-quality, virtual sampling experience of a grand piano. The project is based on meticulously recorded Yamaha C7 Grand Piano samples sourced exclusively from the music program at Loyola University Chicago's Fine Arts department.

The goal of this project is to recreate the authentic sound and expressive dynamics of a grand piano, allowing musicians, composers, and enthusiasts to explore the rich tonal range and intricacies of this beautiful instrument in a digital environment. By leveraging the power of Max/MSP, the project offers a seamless and intuitive interface for interacting with the piano samples, enabling users to capture the essence of a grand piano performance.

## Key Features
- Authentic Piano Samples: The project utilizes professionally recorded samples of a Yamaha C7 Grand Piano, captured with precision and care from the Loyola University Chicago's Fine Arts music program. These samples preserve the character and nuances of a real piano, ensuring a lifelike and expressive playing experience.
- Sample Manipulation: Users can manipulate and shape the piano samples using a variety of controls provided within the Max/MSP program. This includes features such as volume control, and panning which the ability to apply effects to the sampled sound, giving users the freedom to customize the piano's timbre and create unique sonic textures.
- Performance Mode: The project offers a performance mode that allows users to play the sampled piano in real-time using a MIDI controller or a computer keyboard. The interface provides a visually appealing representation of a piano keyboard, making it easy to visualize and play melodies, chords, and intricate musical passages.
- Multilayered Articulations: The Fine Arts Piano Sampler incorporates multiple layers of articulations to capture the subtleties of piano playing techniques. Users can explore a range of expressive styles, including soft, staccato, legato, and sustained notes, enhancing the authenticity of their performances.
- Integration with External Software: The project supports seamless integration with other music production software and digital audio workstations (DAWs). This requires use of Cycling '74 RNBO which allows for exportation of compiled Max/MSP code into both .vst3 and .component (AU) which can be used in a DAW immediately after compilation.
